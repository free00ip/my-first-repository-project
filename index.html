            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Katsiaryna, I'm 23 y.o. and I live in Minsk at the moment. However, my life is divided into three cities and therefore I move around a lot. In addition to this, I like travelling very much!</p>

            <p>I am an easy-going person, I like to try something new, but at the same time I like to have and follow a built-in daily routine.</p>
            <p><i>My motto in life: <q class="motto">Step by Step</q></i>. I think about it every time I start learning something new or when a difficult task or goal appears.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I like a fairly active lifestyle - walking a lot, going to the gym or running in good weather. I like to try different sports activities - so I tried yoga, badminton and fencing. For a more relaxing time, I choose to watch TV series and Formula
                1 races, to listen to a podcast about crimes, or to read books.</p>

            <h3>What brought me to the Codegirl school?</h3>
            <p>I have been looking for and interested in new spheres of work for some time now, in which I could try my hand in the future. It is important for me that my future job allows to maintain the current rhythm of life with all movements and travels,
                as well as be interesting and in demand. After seeing a lot of good reviews about the school and the course trainers, I decided not to waste time and give it a try. After all, if you do not try, then you will not understand whether this
                or that sphere is for You.</p>
